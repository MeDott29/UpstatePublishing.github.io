# UpstatePublishing

I had another idea.  I wonder what it would look like to collaborate with a small group of writers and publish our finished work under a pseudonym.
 It's my way of interpreting the way of publishing company works.  I guess that's just my creative reinterpretation of a publishing company, period.

If you decided to pursue this, the first step would be to
 create a pseudonym and 
decide on the type of writing you all want to collaborate on. 
You could also decide on a style or genre and 
decide on the subject matter or topics you’d like to focus on. 
You could each take turns to write a section or chapter, or all write together, or even each take on different parts of the same story or poem. 
Once you have a finished product, 
you could look into self-publishing your work under the pseudonym or submitting it to a publisher. 
You could also create a website or blog to promote your work and create an online presence for your pseudonym. 
This could be a great way to collaborate with other writers and to get your work out into the world!

Once you have a finished product, you can look into self-publishing or even submitting to traditional publishers. You could also explore digital platforms and social media to promote and share your work. 

No matter the route you decide to take, collaboration with a small group of writers can be an incredibly rewarding and creative experience. Best of luck!

I'm also interested in making an online form for people interested in publishing.

The form will have a few questions that will get you started.  The questions are designed to have you think through some of the important pieces of the process, and help you get the ball rolling.

Here is some information that might be helpful.
